General procedure from start to finish
===========================================================
NOTE: For special circumstances involving only a few
      user defined stations (i.e. user wants data only 
      from ANMO and BJT). The steps are as follows:
      
      1) Skip steps (1-3)
      2) Edit station.cfg
            * Remove undesired stations
            * Edit filter designs
            * Edit exception lists
      3) Run steps (4-5) for the heli plots and html files
